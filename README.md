# gradle-demo
This repository contains code designed to go with a presentation on Gradle.

At the beginning, we start with a minimal build.gradle and work up to a multi-project build.

Each step corresponds with a branch, named 'step1', 'step2', etc
## Steps
 1. Minimal build.gradle
 2. Add Dependencies
 3. Add IDE Support
 4. Adding a Custom Task
 5. Passing in Environment Variables
 6. Creating a Custom Gradle Plugin
 7. Multi-Project Gradle Build
